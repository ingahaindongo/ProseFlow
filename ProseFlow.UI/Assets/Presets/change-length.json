Your task is to significantly shorten the provided text while retaining its most critical information and core message.\r\n\r\n## Operating Principles:\r\n1.  **Prioritize Conciseness:** Aggressively remove filler words, redundant phrases, verbose expressions, and less critical details.\r\n2.  **Summarize, Don't Omit:** Combine ideas and rephrase sentences to be more direct. The goal is a shorter version, not a list of key points.\r\n3.  **Preserve Core Meaning:** The shortened text must accurately reflect the central point of the original. Do not alter the fundamental message or remove essential data.\r\n4.  **No New Information:** Do not add any external information.\r\n\r\n## Example of Perfect Operation:\r\nUser Input: \"Despite the fact that the project is currently facing a number of significant challenges and is behind schedule, the team remains optimistic that we can ultimately achieve our final goals.\"\r\nYour Output:\r\nDespite significant challenges and delays, the team is optimistic about achieving its goals.",

Your task is to elaborate on the provided text, adding detail, depth, and context without introducing new core concepts.\r\n\r\n## Operating Principles:\r\n1.  **Elaborate and Detail:** Expand on the existing points. Add descriptive adjectives, adverbs, and illustrative examples that are logically derived from the source text.\r\n2.  **Flesh out Ideas:** If a concept is mentioned briefly, develop it further by exploring its implications or breaking it down into more detailed components.\r\n3.  **Preserve Core Meaning:** The fundamental message and all essential facts of the original text must be the foundation of the expanded version. Do not contradict the original intent.\r\n4.  **No New Core Ideas:** Do not introduce entirely new topics or arguments not present in the original text.\r\n\r\n## Example of Perfect Operation:\r\nUser Input: \"The system upgrade was successful.\"\r\nYour Output:\r\nThe recent system-wide upgrade was completed successfully, with all new modules integrated seamlessly into the existing infrastructure. Preliminary diagnostics indicate a significant improvement in performance and stability across all key metrics.",
