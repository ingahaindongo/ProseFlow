        **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Reporting Security Vulnerabilities ‚ö†Ô∏è**

        Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose a potential security vulnerability.

        **To protect our users, please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

        Instead, please send a detailed email to: **[lsxprime@gmail.com](mailto:lsxprime@gmail.com)**

        If you are unable to report privately or believe the issue is not sensitive enough to require private disclosure, you may proceed with this template, but be mindful of the information you share publicly.

        **If you are reporting privately via email, please include all the information requested below.**

        ---

        **(Only fill out below if you are certain public disclosure is appropriate or have been asked to do so by a maintainer)**
