# 🎉 ProseFlow v0.2.0 – Release Notes

We’re thrilled to announce **ProseFlow v0.2.0**, a major milestone that significantly expands the application’s capabilities with powerful new features, refined user experience, and robust infrastructure improvements. This release introduces **shared workspace support**, a **floating action orb**, **diff view for safe editing**, **background task tracking**, and much more.

---

## 🌟 Highlights

### 1. **Shared Workspace & Team Sync**
Collaborate seamlessly with your team! ProseFlow now supports **shared workspaces**—a folder (local or cloud-synced) that stores your Actions and Provider configurations.

- **Connect** to a shared workspace during onboarding or via Settings.
- **Encrypt sensitive data** (like API keys) using a workspace password.
- Choose between **Manual** or **Automatic** sync modes.
- Resolve conflicts with configurable strategies: **Overwrite**, **Skip**, or **Prompt**.

> 💡 Ideal for teams wanting consistent AI workflows across machines.

### 2. **Floating Action Orb**
A persistent, draggable orb floats on your screen—offering instant access to ProseFlow without memorizing hotkeys.

- **Click** to open the Floating Action Menu.
- **Right-click** for a quick context menu (Open App, Quit, Close Orb).
- **Drag & drop text** onto the orb to trigger the new **Arc Menu**—a radial menu of your favorite or context-relevant actions.
- Shows a **live badge** indicating active background tasks.
- Fully **customizable**: hide it in Settings if preferred.

---

### 3. **Diff View for Safe Editing**
When using actions with **Diff output mode**, you’ll now see a side-by-side comparison of your original and AI-generated text.

- **Accept**, **Refine**, **Regenerate**, or **Cancel** with confidence.
- Powered by **DiffPlex** with word-level highlighting for precise changes.
- Supports inline refinement instructions for iterative improvements.

> ✅ Perfect for critical edits where you need full control over AI output.

---

### 4. **Background Task Tracker**
All AI actions are now tracked in real time on the **Overview Dashboard**.

- See **active processes**, their status (Queued/Processing), and **elapsed time**.
- **Cancel** long-running tasks directly from the UI.
- Visual feedback on the Floating Orb and in notifications.

## 🛠️ Core & Infrastructure Improvements

### 🔐 **Enhanced Clipboard Service**
A new **multi-layered fallback system** ensures reliable text selection and pasting across all platforms:

1. **Avalonia API** (primary)
2. **Native shell commands** (`xclip`, `pbcopy`, `clip.exe`)
3. **TextCopy library** (fallback)

Greatly improves compatibility with **WSL**, remote desktops, and sandboxed environments.

### ⌨️ **Advanced Hotkey System**
- **Hotkey recording UI** in Settings with live feedback.
- **Conflict detection** to prevent duplicate shortcuts.
- **Unified APIs** for key registration and monitoring and enhance support for non-U.S. keyboards.

### 🧠 **Local Model Enhancements**
- **GPU selection**: Choose a specific GPU or let the system auto-select.
- **Flash Attention** support for faster inference (enabled by default).
- **Thread control**: Adjust CPU thread count for optimal performance.
- Context and token limits increased to **65,536**.

### 📊 **Hardware Monitoring**
- GPU detection and VRAM reporting (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel).
- Polling **pauses when the main window is hidden** to conserve resources.
- Hardware metrics now feed into the Local Dashboard sidebar.

## 🎨 UI & UX Refinements

### 📁 **History View Overhaul**
- **Searchable and filterable** history (by Action Name, Input, or Output).
- **Delete individual entries** or clear all.
