### 🚀 Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is by downloading the latest version from our official website.

### **[➡️ Download from the Official Website ⬅️](https://lsxprime.github.io/proseflow-web)**

The website will automatically suggest the best download for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

1.  **Download the Installer:** Click the main download button on the website for your detected OS, or choose a specific
    version from the options below it.
2.  **Install & Run:** Install the application like any other.
3.  **Onboarding:** The first time you run ProseFlow, a guided setup window will help you configure your first AI
    provider and set your global hotkey. You'll be ready in minutes!

For advanced users who need access to all builds, portable versions, or detailed release notes, you can visit
the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/LSXPrime/ProseFlow/releases).


#### macOS Installation & Permissions

Due to Apple's security policies, you will need to perform a few extra steps to run ProseFlow on macOS:

1.  **Open the App for the First Time:**
    *   After downloading, move `ProseFlow.app` to your `Applications` folder.
    *   Right-click the app and select "Open".
    *   You will see a warning that the developer is unidentified. This is expected. Click "Open" again to confirm. You only need to do this once.

2.  **Grant Required Permissions:**
    ProseFlow needs two critical permissions to function. When prompted, you must grant them.
    *   Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**.
    *   Find **Accessibility** in the list. Click it, and then enable the toggle for **ProseFlow**.
    *   Find **Input Monitoring** in the list. Click it, and then enable the toggle for **ProseFlow**.

*If ProseFlow is not in the list, click the `+` button and add it from your Applications folder.*

### 📖 How to Use

ProseFlow offers multiple ways to process text, designed to be fast and intuitive:

1.  **Hotkey Method (Primary):**
    *   **Select Text:** Highlight any text in any application.
    *   **Press Hotkey:** Press your configured Action Menu hotkey (default is `Ctrl+J`).
    *   **Choose an Action:** The floating menu will appear. Use your mouse or arrow keys to select an action and press `Enter`.
2.  **Drag-and-Drop Method:**
    *   **Drag Text:** Select and drag text from any application.
    *   **Drop on Orb:** Drop the text onto the Floating Action Orb.
    *   **Choose an Action:** The radial Arc Menu will appear around the orb. Click an action to process the text.
3.  **Results:**
    *   For quick edits (like "Proofread"), your selected text will be replaced instantly.
    *   For longer content (like "Explain Code"), a result window will appear with the generated text.

### 🧠 Official Local Models

To provide the best possible out-of-the-box experience, we have fine-tuned and released official models specifically for ProseFlow. These models are optimized to understand the application's unique instruction format and excel at a wide range of tasks.

Both models are available for one-click download directly within ProseFlow from the Model Library (`Providers -> Manage Models...`).

| Model | Best For | VRAM (Approx.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[ProseFlow-v1-1.5B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/LSXPrime/ProseFlow-v1-1.5B-Instruct) (Recommended)** | The **best overall experience**. A versatile model based on `Qwen2.5-Coder` that excels at coding, logical reasoning, and high-quality text generation. The `Q8_0` quant is recommended. | ~2.5 GB |
| **[ProseFlow-v1-360M-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/LSXPrime/ProseFlow-v1-360M-Instruct) (Experimental)** | **Extremely lightweight** use on low-resource devices. Fast, but with significant limitations in reasoning and complex tasks. Suitable for basic text formatting. | ~1 GB |

For most users, the **`1.5B-Instruct`** model provides an ideal balance of high performance and manageable resource requirements.

The task-focused ability of our official models is made possible by the custom dataset they were trained on, which we have also open-sourced for the community, **[ProseFlow-Actions-v1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LSXPrime/ProseFlow-Actions-v1)** is a high-quality, diverse dataset of over 1,800 structured examples. Unlike general-purpose chat datasets, it's specifically designed for the "tool-based" workflow of ProseFlow, focusing on tasks that require high-fidelity text transformation and strict adherence to formatting constraints.


By open-sourcing the data, we invite developers and researchers to inspect our methodology, build upon our work, and create even better small, task-focused models. The dataset is released under the permissive **MIT License**.

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

ProseFlow is built using a modern, layered architecture inspired by **Clean Architecture**, promoting separation of
concerns, testability, and maintainability.

*   **`ProseFlow.Core`**: The domain layer. Contains the core business models, enums, and interfaces for repositories and
    services. It has zero dependencies on other layers.
*   **`ProseFlow.Application`**: The application layer. It orchestrates the business logic using services, DTOs, and
    application-specific events. It depends only on `Core`.
*   **`ProseFlow.Infrastructure`**: The infrastructure layer. Contains all implementations of external concerns,
    including:
    *   **Data Access:** Entity Framework Core with SQLite using the Repository & Unit of Work patterns.
    *   **AI Providers:** Implementations for Cloud (`LlmTornado`) and Local (`LLamaSharp`) providers.
    *   **OS Services:** Cross-platform hotkeys (`SharpHook`), clipboard access, and active window tracking.
*   **`ProseFlow.UI`**: The presentation layer. A cross-platform desktop application built with **Avalonia** and the **ShadUI** component library, following the **MVVM** pattern.

## ❤️ Support This Project

ProseFlow is an open-source project driven by a single developer on a single PC. The goal is to create a powerful, private, and flexible AI writing assistant that works flawlessly for everyone, regardless of their operating system.

However, developing and maintaining a professional cross-platform application comes with significant challenges and costs that are difficult to cover alone.

**The Current Reality:**
ProseFlow is actively developed and tested on **Windows and Linux (via WSL)**. Due to a lack of hardware, **I am currently unable to properly test, debug, build, or release for macOS.** The current macOS support is "best-effort" and relies on community feedback, which is not a sustainable way to ensure a quality product.

### Your Support Directly Enables:

*   **First-Class macOS Support:** The single biggest hurdle for the project. Your contributions will go directly towards acquiring a Mac for dedicated macOS development. This is essential for:
    *   Properly testing and debugging the application.
    *   Building official, signed, and notarized releases.
    *   Fixing platform-specific bugs and ensuring a native feel.

*   **Official Code Signing & Notarization:** To keep the application safe and functional, we need:
    *   **An Apple Developer Account ($99/year):** Required for building and distributing a trusted macOS application.
    *   **A Windows Code Signing Certificate:** Essential for removing the "untrusted application" warnings on Windows, making ProseFlow a secure and trustworthy tool you can rely on.

*   **Dedicated Development Time:** Your support allows me to dedicate more focused time to development, leading to faster feature implementation, more thorough bug fixes, and better overall project quality across all platforms.

You can directly support ProseFlow and help transform it into a truly professional, cross-platform tool through:

*   **AirTM:** For simple one-time donations with various payment options like Direct Bank Transfer (ACH), Debit / Credit Card via Moonpay, Stablecoins, and more than 500 banks and e-wallets.

    [Donate using AirTM](https://airtm.me/lsxprime)

*   **USDT (Tron/TRC20):** Supporting directly by sending to the following USDT wallet address.

    ```markdown
    TKZzeB71XacY3Av5rnnQVrz2kQqgzrkjFn
    ```

    **Important:** Please ensure you are sending USDT via the **TRC20 (Tron)** network. Sending funds on any other network may result in their permanent loss.

**By becoming a sponsor or making a donation, you are directly investing in the future of ProseFlow, helping to overcome critical hardware limitations and ensuring it becomes a reliable, secure, and first-class application for all users. Thank you for your generosity!**
